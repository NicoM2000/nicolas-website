## What is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?

CGT is levied on profit derived from the disposal of a capital assets, such as shares, real estate (investment property), or cryptocurrencies.\
CGT is part of determining the taxpayer’s *income tax*, i.e., the net capital gains are part of their assessable income for the financial year.

A disposal (sale) of an asset that triggers CGT is called a *CGT event*.\
Division 104 of the **Income Tax Assessment Act 1997** lists common CGT events such as:

-   Sale or disposal of a CGT asset\
-   Trading, exchanging or swapping assets\
-   Loss, theft or destruction of asset

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a CGT asset is held for **12 months or more**, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) allows individuals and trusts to discount to 50% the capital gain (proceeds minus cost base) after offsetting any carried forward capital losses.\
Super funds are allowed for a 33.33% discount, but companies are not eligible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, if the asset was acquired before 21 September 1999 11:45 am (**ITAA Sect 114.1**), the taxpayer may choose the *indexation method* which adjusts the cost base for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up to 30 September 1999.
