It reveals that in many real-world datasets, small leading digits (i.e. 1) are counter-intuitively more likely to occur than large digits. This pattern seems to be present in a wide range of cases, ranging from:\n\n🗳 election results;\n🏡 street addresses;\n📊 financial data;\n⚰️ mortality statistics;\n🧪 to molecular weights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📐 Generalised Benford’s Law: The Formula Behind the Pattern\n\n\nThe probability that a number begins with digit d (from 1 through 9) is:\n\n\n\\[\nP(d) = \\log_{10} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{d} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\\(P(d)\\) is the probability that the first digit is \\(d\\)\nThe logarithm is base-10\nThis formula shows why 1 appears about 30.1% of the time, while 9 only shows up around 4.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📊 Benford’s Law Expected Distribution\nThe plot below shows the probability distribution predicted by Benford’s Law for the first digit (1–9). As you can see, the digit 1 appears ~30% of the time, while 9 appears less than 5%."

    "text": "What is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?\nCGT is levied on profit derived from the disposal of a CGT asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985, where the realisation is not undertaken in the ordinary course of carrying on a business; otherwise, the gain will be assessable under s6-5.\nAccording to s108-5(2), CGT assets encompass: land and buildings (including rental properties), shares in a company, units in a unit trust, rights and options, leases, goodwill, debts owed to a taxpayer, foreign currency, and cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin).\nThe net capital gain derived from the disposal of a CGT asset is considered as statutory income and is included in the taxpayer’s income tax return under Item 18 (s105-5).\nHowever, if an overall net capital loss arises, the amount is not deductible in the income year it occurred. Instead, it is carried forward indefinitely (quarantined) and applied to future capital gains.\nA disposal (sale) of an asset that triggers CGT is called a CGT event. Division 104-5 identifies 56 CGT events or ways to dispose of such assets. However, two events occur in 95% of cases:\n\nA1: Disposal of a CGT Asset\nThese include the change of legal ownership (sale, transfer, exchange, gift) or destruction of such assets, where timing is usually determined by the date when the contract is signed or the date of settlement in the absence of a contract.\nC1: Loss or Destruction of a CGT Asset\nHere, the timing will depend on whether the taxpayer receives compensation in respect to this event.\n\nIf the CGT asset is insured, a CGT event occurs when the taxpayer first receives compensation/insurance payment.\nIf the CGT asset is not insured, C1 occurs when the destruction or loss happens or is first discovered. Note: capital losses are calculated as cost base minus capital proceeds, where cost base is at historical cost (not the market value at the time of destruction)."

    "text": "FBT Administration\n\nThe FBT regime runs from 1 April to 31 March\nFBT is a self-assessed return prepared by the employer, and is a separate form from BAS and IAS\nIf self-prepared, FBT must be lodged and paid by 21 May, or 25 June if lodged by a tax agent\nIf the taxpayer’s FBT is less than $3,000, the liability is settled in one annual payment by one of the above due dates.\nIf more than the threshold, the ATO requires FBT to be paid in quarterly instalments plus an annual payment of any outstanding amount, in which case Label F1 of the taxpayer’s BAS will be shown.\nF1 is the annual FBT estimate provided by the ATO based on the taxpayer’s prior FBT assessment, and it is pre-printed on the Activity Statement. Taxpayers can vary (adjust) their quarterly instalments based on their updated estimate for the FBT year ending 31 March. The ATO provides several reasons for making these variations.\nFBT rate typically corresponds to the highest marginal tax rate plus Medicare levy. A 47% rate currently applies across the 31 March 2022 to 31 March 2026 FBT years.\nSection 136(1) of the Act broadly defines a benefit to include “any right, privilege, service or facility”, which encompasses anything of value provided as part of or in lieu of a salary package (except for salary and wages), which is designed to reduce the income tax liability of the employee.\nThe taxable value of a fringe benefit must be grossed up before calculating the fringe benefit tax. Grossing up helps to equate non-cash benefits with salary levels, enabling the ATO to tax these benefits as if they were income. This process allows for a fair comparison between different types of compensation.\nThe gross-up factor depends on whether the employer can claim GST credit related to the cost of providing the benefit. Type 1 fringes are GST credit claimable, whereas Type 2 fringes are those that are not Type 1 benefits (i.e., either the benefit is GST-free or the employer is not eligible to claim an input tax).\n\n\nFurther details and official requirements are published on the ATO’s website."
