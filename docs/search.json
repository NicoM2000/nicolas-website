It reveals that in many real-world datasets, small leading digits (i.e. 1) are counterintuitively more likely to occur than large digits. This patterns seems to be present in a wide range of cases, ranging from:\n\n🗳️ election results,\n🏡 street addresses,\n📊 financial data,\n⚰️ mortality stats,\n🧪 to molecular weights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 📐 Generalised Benford’s Law: The Formula Behind the Pattern\n\n\nThe probability that a number begins with digit d (from 1 through 9) is:\n\n\n\\[\nP(d) = \\log_{10} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{d} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\\(P(d)\\) is the probability that the first digit is \\(d\\)\nThe logarithm is base-10\nThis formula shows why 1 appears about 30.1% of the time, while 9 only shows up around 4.6%\n\n\n\n\n📊 Benford’s Law Expected Distribution The plot below shows the probability distribution predicted by Benford’s Law for the first digit (1–9). As you can see, the digit 1 appears ~30% of the time, while 9 appears less than 5%."
